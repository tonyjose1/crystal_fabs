# Project Progress

This document tracks the development progress of the Crystal Fabs website.

## Phase 1: Foundation and Initial Setup (Completed)

### Summary of Work Done

- **Project Setup:** Initialized a Next.js frontend and an Express.js backend, and configured PostgreSQL with Prisma.
- **Backend:** Created API endpoints, ran database migrations, and seeded the database with initial data.
- **Frontend:** Set up pages, created a component library, and implemented a modern UI with a custom theme, responsive navigation, and animated sections for products, projects, and testimonials.
- **Integration:** Connected the frontend to the backend to fetch live data and implemented a functional quote form with file uploads.

### Challenges and Resolutions

During this phase, we encountered several challenges, primarily related to the frontend configuration:

- **ESM Module Errors:** The backend failed to start due to `import` statements being used outside a module. This was resolved by setting `"type": "module"` in the `backend/package.json` file.
- **Missing Dependencies:** The backend server failed to start due to a missing `express-validator` package. This was resolved by installing the package.
- **Tailwind CSS Configuration:** We faced persistent issues with the Tailwind CSS configuration, resulting in errors like `Cannot apply unknown utility class`. This was a multi-step resolution:
  1.  We initially tried different configurations in `postcss.config.js`.
  2.  We identified and removed conflicting `package-lock.json` files.
  3.  The final fix was to move the custom `colors` and `fontFamily` definitions out of the `theme.extend` object in `tailwind.config.js`, which allowed Tailwind to correctly recognize and apply the custom theme.

## Phase 2: Tooling and Bug Fixes (Completed)

### Summary of Work Done

- **Tooling:**
  - **Linting:** Set up ESLint for both the frontend and backend to enforce code quality and catch potential errors.
  - **Testing:** Implemented Jest with React Testing Library for the frontend and Jest with Supertest for the backend to create a comprehensive testing suite.
- **Bug Fixes:**
  - **Data Display:** Resolved issues on the products and projects pages where items were not being displayed due to incorrect data handling and image rendering.
  - **Hydration Errors:** Fixed Next.js hydration errors by correcting the usage of the `next/image` component and ensuring proper styling of parent elements.
  - **Form Handling:** Addressed type errors and improved the UI of the file input in the quote form.

## Next Steps

The next phase will focus on enhancing the visual appeal and user experience of the website.
