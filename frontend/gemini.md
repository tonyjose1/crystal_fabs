# Gemini AI Log - Crystal Fabs Frontend

This document outlines the thought process, commands, and actions taken by the Gemini AI assistant during the development of the Crystal Fabs frontend.

## Phase 1: Project Scaffolding and Componentization

- **Objective:** To establish a robust and scalable frontend architecture using Next.js and TypeScript, with a focus on creating a modular and reusable component library.
- **Key Activities:**
  - Initialized a new Next.js project with TypeScript.
  - Organized the project structure into logical directories for pages, components, styles, and utilities.
  - Developed a comprehensive set of reusable components, including:
    - `FeatureList`: For displaying lists of features or services.
    - `Footer`: The standard site footer.
    - `GalleryCard`: For showcasing images in a gallery format.
    - `Header`: The main site navigation header.
    - `Hero`: The hero section for the homepage.
    - `ImageWithFallback`: An image component with a fallback for broken links.
    - `InfoCard`: For displaying informational content in a card format.
    - `ProductCard`: For displaying individual products.
    - `QuoteForm`: A form for requesting quotes.
    - `ScrollToTop`: A button to scroll to the top of the page.
    - `TeamCard`: For displaying team member information.
    - `TestimonialCard`: For displaying customer testimonials.
- **Challenges:**
  - Ensured consistent styling and theming across all components using Tailwind CSS.
  - Implemented responsive design to ensure a seamless experience across all devices.
- **Outcome:** Successfully created a well-structured and component-driven frontend, laying a solid foundation for future development.

## Phase 2: Page Creation and Content Integration

- **Objective:** To build out the primary pages of the website and integrate them with the backend API.
- **Key Activities:**
  - Created the main pages of the website, including:
    - `about`: The "About Us" page.
    - `contact`: The "Contact Us" page.
    - `industries`: A page showcasing the industries served.
    - `products`: The main products page.
    - `projects`: A gallery of completed projects.
    - `services`: A page detailing the services offered.
  - Developed dynamic routing for individual product and project pages.
  - Utilized the `api.ts` utility to fetch data from the backend and populate the pages with dynamic content.
- **Challenges:**
  - Managed application state effectively to handle data fetching and updates.
  - Implemented error handling to gracefully manage API failures.
- **Outcome:** Successfully launched a fully functional website with dynamic content and a seamless user experience.

## Phase 3: Tooling and Bug Fixes

- **Objective:** To improve code quality, set up a testing framework, and resolve existing bugs and UI issues.
- **Key Activities:**
  - **ESLint:** Utilized the existing ESLint setup to identify and fix several issues, including replacing `<img>` tags with the `next/image` `Image` component to improve performance and resolve linting warnings.
  - **Jest and React Testing Library:** Set up Jest and React Testing Library to enable component testing. This included configuring Jest for a Next.js environment and resolving issues with `@testing-library/jest-dom`.
  - **Component and Page Fixes:**
    - **Hydration Errors:** Resolved hydration errors on the products and projects pages by correcting the usage of the `next/image` component, ensuring that parent elements have the correct `position` and that the `sizes` prop is used with `fill`.
    - **Data Display:** Fixed a bug where products and projects were not being displayed due to incorrect image handling in the `ProductCard` and `GalleryCard` components.
    - **Forms:** Corrected type errors in the `QuoteForm` and `Contact` page, and improved the UI of the file input to be more user-friendly.
